<<This file should be deleted in a real project>>

Specific code for the project, create one file per module the project requires.

For example, if the project needs to manage some S3 reports, we could create a
integration file s3_reports.py here, and use the S3 wrapper (wrappers.aws.s3) along with
specific code to the project, some sample functions: read_report(date), write_report_to_json(), etc
